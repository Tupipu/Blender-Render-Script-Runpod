# Blender-Render-Script-Runpod

This repo is part of my YouTube demo on how to use Runpod

First, make sure that you're in /workspace directory as highlighted below

JupyterLab - Google Chrome 02-12-2023 16_39_55


Open the terminal by clicking on the terminal icon and copy paste the following command.

<p>
  <code id="wgetCmd">wget "https://github.com/Tupipu/Blender-Render-Script-Runpod/raw/main/Runpod-Blender-Render-Script-(tupipu.com).ipynb"</code>
  <button onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(document.getElementById('wgetCmd').innerText)">Copy</button>
</p>

Or else you and also download the script here locally and drag and drop the file into the Jupyter IDE on Runpod.

Play all the snippets one by one. If you face any issues, feel free to create an issue.
